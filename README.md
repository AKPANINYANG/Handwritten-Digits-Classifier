Welcome to the **Handwritten Digits Classifier** project repository! This repository contains the code and resources for the project completed as part of the **Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch** course by Udacity.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit classification is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It has a wide range of applications, including optical character recognition (OCR) systems, postal automation, and digit recognition in documents.

In this project, I have built a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits. I used the famous **MNIST dataset**, which consists of images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The goal was to train a neural network that can accurately recognize the digits in these images.
